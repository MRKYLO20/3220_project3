KNOWN PROBLEMS

Currently I have an issue storing large allocations, mainly that the limit is 100 and the
program has to loop through the array to get the big pages.

DESIGN

For small blocks, I kept a table to hold a list of pages and sizes.
When finding which size to use, I used the clz formula to automatically place it without looking up
For large blocks, the system is simpler (array) and slower (looping through) but gets the job done
I use a lot of help functions to get all this done
